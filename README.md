# STCT: Short-Time Chebyshev Transform

Code for the paper **"Short-Time Chebyshev Transform: Efficient Local Polynomial Representations of Time Series"** (submitted to *Neural Processing Letters*).

STCT describes each window of a time series by the coefficients of a low-degree Chebyshev least-squares fit plus the fit residual. It is closed-form, needs no training, works with any learner, and its feature size does not depend on series length.

## Results

Same 300-tree random forest for all three representations.

| Task | Metric | Wavelet | STFT | **STCT** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Classification (116 UCR) | Accuracy | 0.730 | 0.755 | **0.783** |
| | Features | 566 | 598 | **138** |
| Regression (26 TSER) | RMSE | 138.83 | 151.67 | **138.33** |
| | Features | 1839 | 1955 | **134** |
| | Total time (s) | 16.59 | 18.14 | **1.51** |

## Usage

```bash
pip install aeon pywavelets scikit-learn scipy matplotlib pandas numpy
```

Open a notebook (Colab or Jupyter) and run all cells. Datasets download automatically via `aeon`. Results are saved as `results_classification.csv` and `results_regression.csv`.

Default STCT setting: degree 4, two scales (8 and 16 windows).
